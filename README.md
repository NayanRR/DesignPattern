# Strategy Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Strategy Design Pattern** is one of the most popular behavioral design patterns. It enables a method to be defined in a class in such a way that it can be selected at runtime from a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors. This design pattern promotes flexibility and reusability in software systems by decoupling the behavior from the context in which it is used.

## Key Concepts
- **Context**: The class that maintains a reference to one of the strategies.
- **Strategy Interface**: An interface that defines a common behavior for all the strategies.
- **Concrete Strategies**: Classes that implement the `Strategy` interface with different algorithms or behaviors.

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you are traveling and you can switch between different modes of transportation (e.g., walking, driving, flying). Each mode of transportation is a different strategy for getting to your destination. The journey itself (the context) does not change, but the strategy (transportation mode) does.
